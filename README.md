# FeelingMaps
Each city has its own characteristics, defined by its own people. On the one hand, there may be spots that are best suited for shopping or spots that are best suited for sporting activities. On the other hand, other places may be dangerous for people, whether due to high traffic or to high crime. It becomes now essential to allow people to perceive where such places are. Hence, in this work it his expected (1) the development of methods to define a city grid based on its map and (2) the development of a mobile app where a user is able to classify its feeling about a certain region and indicate a description for his feeling. More goals could be, for example, to define the city’s grid in terms of a multitude of features including people's feelings, dangerous zones or congested areas.
